SU2 was compiled with single precision linear algebra for this example.
This example was run with 640 cores, the relaxation factor for ILU smoothing may have to be adjusted when deviating from this.
There are two configuration files provided for the primal, the first is to ramp the CFL, then the second config (with fixed CFL) should be used.
